    <h1 class="title">Hi! I'm Sakshi</h1>
    <p id="animation">
      I used to be a person who never enjoyed coding and because of that I choose
      ECE as my major in B.Tech. but guess what life had other plans and I
      somehow got placed in an IT firm. So with no other choice I had to learn
      coding. But after being a Front-End Developer for 2 years I personally love it and yes it
      is frustarting at times but once you get along trust me its beautiful!!
